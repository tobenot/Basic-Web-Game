# Contributing to Carrot Web Game Template

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is open to all, and we welcome any contributions, from bug fixes to new features.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue and provide as much information as possible, including:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen and what actually happened.
- Your operating system, browser, and Node.js version.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate efforts and ensure the suggestion fits the project's goals.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Make your changes in your forked repository.
3.  Ensure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
4.  Add or update tests for your changes if applicable (`npm run test`).
5.  Make sure all tests pass.
6.  Update the documentation (`DOCUMENTATION.md` or other relevant files) if you are changing behavior or adding a feature.
7.  Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Documentation

Good documentation is as important as the code itself. If you're contributing a feature, please make sure to update `DOCUMENTATION.md` accordingly.

For documentation in other languages, you can create a localized version of the file, for example:
- `README.zh-CN.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION.zh-CN.md`

This approach keeps different language versions separate and easy to manage, which aligns with your idea of "atomic updates".

## Style Guide

Please follow the existing code style. This project uses Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent style. We recommend you format your code before committing.
